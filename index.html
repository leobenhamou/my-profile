	 <H2>Marketing</H2>
     <p>A field that I could appreciate during my internship in Miami, in a company reselling luxury sneakers: Addict but also last year in France in a large company such as Toyota. 
     <p>A sector in development and which proposes various professions. <p>
     Communication and marketing have never been so important and strategic for companies and associations.
     <p>A changing sector in a context of globalization and technological development. 
     I would like to do my internship either in a company or in a communication company.<p>

The final objective is to know the daily life of people who work in marketing and the means to access these jobs.

	 <H2>Magieüßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</H2>
      <p> Passionate <strong>from Harry Potter</strong>  Since I was a child, I discovered a passion for the world of magic and illusion. I started to learn magic in a school and later I became self-taught and learned via the internet and especially YouTube. <p> I specialized in <strong>la street magie</strong> , card or coin tricks or close-up tricks with everyday objects.<p> What I like in magic is to make people dream and that's what I would like to do again later in my professional project like Apple does with its products.
